AAFShellExt Notes
20 Feb 2002
Jim Trainor

AAFShellExt is a Microsoft Windows Explorer rooted namespace
extension.  It implements, among others, the IShellFolder, IEnumIDList
and IShellView interfaces used by explorer to support browsing and
viewing of what ever data the underlying COM implementation supports.

The implementation is based on a book called "Windows Shell
Programming" by Scott Seely, ISBN 0-13-025496-7.  There are a number
of header files and static libraries that ship with this book that are
required to compile AAFShellExt.  The book's software license prevents
distribution of these header files and libraries.  (I don't think
there are any restrictions on derived works.)  A later version of
AAFShellExt may or may not depend on these header files and libraries.

I have a pre-built ready to install (using Install Shield) version of
AAFShellExt.  Contact me if you would like to get a copy:
jim_trainor@aafassociation.org

When testing AAFShellExt, please take note of the debugging tips in
section 9.6 of the book: "Test and Debugging Namespace Extensions".

Most of the code that I added is in AxShellExt.{cpp,h}.  This code is
quite "raw" at the moment.  The code will be cleaned, and some minor
improvements implemented soon.  Probably in March.  The so-called
"recursive iterator" (AxBaseObjRecIter, in axLib) that AxShellExt.cpp
depends on will also be restructured at that time.

AAFShellExt use axLib, as such, it expects an environment variable
named AX_AAF_COMAPI that is set to the full path of the AAF COM
library.  For example:

  AX_AAF_COMAPI = c:/yourpath/AAF/AAFWinSDK/Debug/Refimpl/AAFCOAPI.dll
