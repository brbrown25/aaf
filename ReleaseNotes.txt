  AIFC codec incorrect bytesPerFrame bug fixed
  Removed 2GB filesize limit in CDCI codec

New Examples:
  ExportDV, ImportDV
  ExportPCM, ImportPCM

New Utilities:
  aafextract - extract all essence streams from an AAF file as separate files
  aaf2xtl - AAF to Microsoft XTL utility
            see Utilities/aaf2xtl/doc/Aaf2XtlSoftwareDescription.pdf
  aafdump - structured storage dumper using choice of libgsf/ole32 API

Portability:
  - Linux x86-64 platform supported
  - Added UTF-8 filename support
  - added support for libgsf structured storage in addition to SchemaSoft
  - Win32/i686Linux/PPCDarwin SchemaSoft libraries can now write >2GB files

Removed features:
  - OMF libraries are no longer part of the AAF SDK project.  The libraries
    can be downloaded from http://www.aafassociation.org/download/
  - Support for Mac OS 9 has been removed


Compatibility with earlier releases
-----------------------------------

- Files generated by the AAF v1.1 SDK cannot be read by earlier AAF SDKs,
  due to a limitation in the metadictionary processing code of SDKs prior
  to AAF v1.1.


Notes
-----

- To create 4kB sector AAF files use any of the following interfaces.
  When embedding large amounts of essence in an AAF file (e.g. 10 minutes of
  DV material) 4kB sectors are necessary to overcome the 2GB filesize limit.
    AAFFileOpenNewModify( filename, AAF_FILE_MODE_USE_LARGE_SS_SECTORS, ...)
    AAFFileOpenNewModifyEx( filename, kAAFFileKind_Aaf4KBinary, ...)
    AAFCreateRawStorageDisk(...) followed by
      AAFCreateAAFFileOnRawStorage(..., kAAFFileKind_Aaf4KBinary, ...)


Structured Storage implementation (where applicable)
----------------------------------------------------

The AAF SDK requires an implementation of Structured Storage to be
provided on the platform. This may be provided as part of the operating
system, as part of an another application, as a proprietary library or
as an open source library.

The AAF Association is starting work on its own open source implementation
of Structured Storage to maximise the range of platforms on which AAF can be
used.

In the meantime, for the cases where such a library is not already
available, a pre-compiled Structured Storage library is provided
(libSSRW2C.a and ssrw_c.lib) for use on the supported platforms. The
pre-compiled Structured Storage library is licensed under an agreement
between the AAF Association and a proprietary Structured Storage library
vendor:
  http://www.aafassociation.org/html/licenses/SchemaSoftTerms.pdf
  (reproduced in text form at the end of this document)

This proprietary library may be redistributed as part of the AAF SDK under
the conditions of that agreement. If you need to port this proprietary
Stuctured Storage library to another platform, please get in touch with the
AAF Association (info@aafassociation.org).  Below is the list of all
pre-compiled Structured Storage proprietary libraries in the AAF SDK.
    AAFWinSDK/sss-impl/ssrw_c.lib
    AAFi686LinuxSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a
    AAFSparcSolarisSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a
    AAFPPCDarwinSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a
    AAFPPCDarwinSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.dylib
    AAFMipsIrixSDK/MIPSpro/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a
    AAFx86_64LinuxSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a

As an alternative, the open source libgsf library is also
supported with some limitations - see Known Issues below for details.


Known Issues
------------
- The pre-compiled Structured Storage implementation provided for Irix and
  the MIPSPro 7.3.1 compiler has the following limitations:
    ScaleTest failure for embedded essence streams >2GB in Structured Storage
	files with 4096 byte sectors
  UTF8FileNameTest failure for opening filenames containing international
  characters

- The SDK will fail at runtime when compiled using the MIPSpro 7.4.1
  C++ compiler.  For example, InfoDumper and ComModAAF will abort with:
  Assertion failed:
    _elementType && TypeDefinition::null() != _elementType,
    file AAFObjectModel.cpp, line 2826

- The Microsoft Structured Storage implementation (ole32.dll) (part of the
  MS Windows platform) can fail when reading or writing 512-byte Structured
  Storage AAF files containing a large number of objects. This does not
  occur with the pre-compiled Structured Storage implementation provided
  with the AAF SDK or the libgsf implementation. The performance and
  scalability of the AAF SDK and a Structured Storage library can be
  evaluated using the ScaleTest scripts.

- The libgsf Structured Storage implementation has the following limitations
  in conjuction with the AAF SDK:
  - No edit-in-place functionality.  This will cause a run-time failure in
    the AAFFileOpenExistingModify() interface call.
  - No RawStorage functionality causing the following interfaces to fail
    - AAFFileOpenNewModifyEx()
    - AAFCreateRawStorageDisk()
    - AAFCreateRawStorageCachedDisk()
    - AAFCreateAAFFileOnRawStorage()
      
  In practice these limitations restrict a client application's use of the SDK
  to only "Import AAF" and "Export AAF" operations using the following APIs:
    - AAFFileOpenExistingRead() (importing from an existing AAF file)
    - AAFFileOpenNewModify() (exporting to a new AAF file)

  To select the libgsf implementation and assuming you have libgsf installed
  under /usr/local, run make as follows
    make LIBGSF_PATH=/usr/local

- The AxLib library (examples2/axLib) does not compile using gcc-4.0.0


SchemaSoft license agreement

Association and SchemaSoft Corporation allows us (the AAF Association) to
