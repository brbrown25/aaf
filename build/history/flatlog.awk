# Flatten the output of "cvs log".
#
# Author : Tim Bingham - Tim_Bingham@avid.com
#
# A flattened log is easier to process than the output of "cvs log".
# The idea is that the log is first flattened and then the flat log
# is used as input to other tools. The output of "cvs log" is for people
# to read, the output of this program is for other programs to read.
#
# Example :
#
# $ cvs log > Everything.log
# $ cat Everything.log | awk -f flatlog.awk  > Everything.flog
#
# The following prints the date and time of the most recent change
# preceeding application of the Build-0505 tag.
#
# $ grep Build-0505 Everything.flog | \ 
#   sort -r -k 3 -k 4 | \ 
#   head -n 1 | \ 
#   awk '{print $3 $4}'
#
# Functionality : Flattening the log includes -
#
#   - putting the information (revision, date, user etc.) about each
#     action (add, change or remove a file) all on one line
#   - treating the act of tagging a file as just another action, in this case
#     the date and time are the date and time of the tagged revision and not
#     the date and time the tag was applied (cvs doesn't record this)
#
# Output format :
#
#   One line for each action (the lines are in no particular order).
#   Each line consists of space separated fields as follows -
#
#  <file> <revision> <date> <time> <user> <action> ...
#
# There are a variable number of fields following <action>, these
# depend on the value of <action> as follows -
#
#   <action>                             ...
#     A (add    - cvs add; cvs commit)   log-message
#     C (change - cvs commit)            log-message
#     R (remove - cvs remove)            log-message
#     T (tag    - cvs tag or cvs rtag)   tag-name
#
# Bugs:
#
# There are bugs here for
#
#  - log messages that look like fields in the header information
#  - file names containing spaces/tabs
