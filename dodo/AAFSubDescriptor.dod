/// values:
/// 
/// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
///   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
///     operation.
///
/// AAFRESULT_NOT_INITIALIZED
///   - This object has not yet had Initialize\(\) called on it through
///     this object's primary interface.  Note that IAAFSubDescriptor is a
///     primary interface for an abstract class\, so it is not
///     appropriate for the Initialize\(\) method to exist in this
///     interface.  The Initialize\(\) method is available through the
///     concrete object's primary interface.
