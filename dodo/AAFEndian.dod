// This interface is used to allow the user to determine the byte
// order of this object.  Note that the byte order of the object
// stored in the AAF file may be different from the native byte order
// of this machine.  Note also that both pieces of information are
// available here.
//
// Byte order of newly created AAF files is set upon creation of that
// file.  It is set to the byte order of the creating machine.
//
// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
// values:
// 
// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
//   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
//     operation.
//
// AAFRESULT_NOT_INITIALIZED
//   - This object has not yet had Initialize\(\) called on it through
//     this object's primary interface.  Note that IAAFEndian is not a
//     primary interface for a concrete class\, so it is not
//     appropriate for the Initialize\(\) method to exist in this
//     interface.  The Initialize\(\) method is available through the
//     concrete object's primary interface.
