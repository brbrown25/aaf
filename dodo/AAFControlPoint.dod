// The IAAFControlPoint interface is implemented by objects that store an individual point value
// of a parameter whose value changes during the operation group.  IAAFControlPoints must be added to
// an object which implements IAAFVaryingValue\, which is then added to the IAAFOperationGroup.
//
// For parameters which are constant in value during the operation group\, use IAAFConstantValue.
//
// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
// values:
// 
// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
//   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
