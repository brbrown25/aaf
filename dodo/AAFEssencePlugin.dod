// The AAFEssencePlugin interface describes the calls available
// to all plugins \(ex. Codecs and Interpolators\).  This interface
//  is used internally by the SDK\, and is not exported through the
// client interface.
//
// The AAFPluginManager keeps a copy of each plugin in a table\, along
// with cached copies of pertinant metadata about the plugin\, and
// instantiates a copy of the plugin when required.
//
// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
// values:
//
// AAFRESULT_NULL_PARAM
//   - One of the passed in pointers is NULL.
//
// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
//   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
//     operation.
