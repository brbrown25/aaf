set -e MacDodo "{aaf}AAFMacSDK:dodo:"
set Commands "{Commands},{MacDodo}Tool:"

 # Where you installed MacPerl

Notes

Before running dodo on Macintosh consider temporarily commenting out
the line that says
  SetFile -m . "{DSTFILE}"
in file
  :AAFMacSDK:dodo:tool:copy_if_diff
this will, depending on your CVS client (currently true for MAC CVS
Pro) , make files whose contents have not changed, appear as localy
modified.

This is also true on Windows of WinCVS, in that case consider
temporarily modifying the line that says
  touch $2
in file
  update.ksh
