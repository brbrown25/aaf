Instructs the enumerator to position itself at the beginning of the list of elements. 
  // @comm There is no guarantee that the same set of elements will be enumerated on 
  // each pass through the list\, nor will the elements necessarily be enumerated in 
  // the same order. The exact behavior depends on the collection being enumerated.)

  // record a point in the enumeration sequence in order to return to that point 
  // at a later time.
  // @comm The caller must release this new enumerator separately from the first enumerator.)
