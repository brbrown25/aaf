AD_IDL(//
// The IAAFEssenceDataStream interface is an additional interface implemented by objects
// which stream over AAF files\, and were therefore created by the AAFContainerDef for
// AAF files.  This interface allows the setting of one additional parameter \(a pointer
// to the AAFEssenceData object to stream over\) which was not general-purpose enough
// to be in the IAAFEssenceStream interface.
//
// Objects which support this interface must be created by methods in IAAFContainerDef\, since
// the container definition is what is used to differentiate between the different streams.
// If the stream needs a reference to data other than a file pointer \(ex. the AAFContainer
// makes a stream which needs a reference to a structureed storage stream\) will have another
// interface to support the additional behaviour.  For an AAF container\, the additional interface
// is IAAFEssenceDataStream.
//
// The following has been copied from the IAAFEssenceStream interface:
//		The IAAFEssenceStream interface is an internal interface used by AAFEssenceAccess and
//		essence codecs to read the low-level representation of the essence.  There are multiple
//		classes implementing this interface\, each representing a different underlying container
//		holding the essence data.  The idea of \"container\" is separate from any formatting such
//		as WAVE or JPEG.  Examples of containers \(and therefore streams\)\, are essence embedded
//		in AAF files\, and essence in a file all by itself \(ex. a WAVE file\).
