  // points to the class definition of the least-derived class which

  // 
  // pTargetSet points to an array of Property Def AUIDs which
  // indicate the location of the property containing the target of
  // this weak reference.  The AUIDs indicate the containment path to
  // the target property\, starting at the root Header object.  For
  // example\, if the containment hierarchy is:
  // Header->A->B->C
  // then the first AUID corresponds to the Header's property which
  // contains Object A; the second AUID corresponds to Object A's
  // property which contains Object B; and the third AUID corresponds
  // to Object B's property C which contans the target of this weak
  // reference.  If any intermediate property is a vector or set\,
  // *all* objects in that vector or set are searched for the target.
  // Note that the final AUID *must* correspond to a Set property.

  // The number of AUIDs in pTargetSet is noted by ids.
