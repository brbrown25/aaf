// The IAAFCommentMarker interface is implemented by objects which represent
// a user comment associated with a point in time. A CommentMarker may
// have a SourceReference that specifies a text or audio annotation.
//
// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
// values:
// 
// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
//   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
//     operation.
//
// AAFRESULT_NOT_INITIALIZED
//   - This object has not yet had Initialize\(\) called on it through
//     this object's primary interface.  Note that IAAFMobSlot is a
//     primary interface for an abstract class\, so it is not
//     appropriate for the Initialize\(\) method to exist in this
//     interface.  The Initialize\(\) method is available through the
//     concrete object's primary interface.
