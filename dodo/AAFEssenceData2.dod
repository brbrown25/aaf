/// The IAAFEssenceData2 interface is used to modify AAFEssenceData
/// objects\, which contain the actual essence data \(ex. WAVE\) when
/// it is contained within an AAF file.  Normally the client
/// application would access the essence through the IAAFEssenceAccess
/// interface\, which handles the work of finding and \(de\)compressing
/// the data.  However\, in rare cases direct access to the data is
/// required\, so this interface is exposed.
///
/// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
/// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
/// values:
///
/// AAFRESULT_NULL_PARAM
///   - One of the passed in pointers is NULL.
///
/// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
///   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
