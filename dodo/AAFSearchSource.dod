//
// AAFRESULT_NOT_INITIALIZED
//   - This object has not yet had Initialize\(\) called on it through

  // The returned component and find source info are AddRef\(\)ed
  // before they are returned.

  // Succeeds if all of the following are true:
  // - ppSourceInfo is non-NULL
  // - a Mob of the requested kind is found
  // 
  // This method will return the following codes.  If more than one of

  // 
  // AAFRESULT_SUCCESS
  //   - succeeded.  \(This is the only code indicating success.\)
  //
  // AAFRESULT_NULL_PARAM
