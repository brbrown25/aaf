AD_IDL(//
// The IAAFTransition interface is implemented by objects describe a change or transition
// from one piece of essence to another.  Transitions must exist in the context of a sequence\,
// and must be surrounded on both sides by segments \(an object which has an IAAFSegment interface\).
//
// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
// values:
// 
// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
//   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
//     operation.
//
// AAFRESULT_NOT_INITIALIZED
//   - This object has not yet had Initialize\(\) called on it through
//     this object's primary interface.  Note that IAAFMob is a
//     primary interface for an abstract class\, so it is not
//     appropriate for the Initialize\(\) method to exist in this
//     interface.  The Initialize\(\) method is available through the
//     concrete object's primary interface.
