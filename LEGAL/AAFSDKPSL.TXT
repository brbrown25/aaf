If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add Your name as a Contributor to such a notice in any file containing such Modification(s).

Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this Agreement under this Section 6.1 shall survive.  Any license granted by you to any Contributor or the Standards Body, and any end user license agreement for Larger Works containing or linking to the AAF SDK in Executable form that have been validly granted by You hereunder prior to termination shall continue in full force even after such termination.
