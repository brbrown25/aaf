# This make file is normally called from the top level makefile
# (../GNUmakefile) using the "dist" target.

# Windows Notes:
#
# The top level make target does not currently work under Win2K.
# Instead, run the following from this directory:
#
#    make AAFPLATFORM=Win AAFSDK=../AAFWinSDK release-dist
#    make AAFPLATFORM=Win AAFSDK=../AAFWinSDK sdk-dist
#
# It was tested using Cygwin.

# Mac Notes:
#
# The top level make target does not currently work under Mac OS 9.
# Instead, run the following from this directory:
#
#   mkdir -p ../AAFMacSDK/Dist
#   cp release-files.mac ../AAFMacSDK/Dist/release-files
#  ./CreateDistribution.bash release Dist/release-files Dist/aaf_release ../AAFMacSDK Mac ../ref-impl/include/AAFSDKBuild.h
#
#   mkdir -p ../AAFMacSDK/Dist
#   cp sdk-files.mac ../AAFMacSDK/Dist/sdk-files
#  ./CreateDistribution.bash sdk Dist/sdk-files Dist/aaf_sdk ../AAFMacSDK Mac ../ref-impl/include/AAFSDKBuild.h
# 
#   The folowing should work, when/if a pdefs-Mac.mk file appears in the build directory.
#
#    make AAFPLATFORM=Mac AAFSDK=../AAFMacSDK release-dist
#    make AAFPLATFORM=Mac AAFSDK=../AAFMacSDK sdk-dist
# 
# Pending some form of top-level-build resolution, the above commands
# can be executed using "make mac"
#
# Note, as of V101 the SDK only supports OS9.  The OS X developers
# toolkit (available from Apple) includes GNU make, and other GNU
# tools.  Bash must be compiled It was tested using Cygwin.  The
# CreateDistribution.bash script is quite simple, hence, sh should
# work in lieu of bash.  The script can be executed from OS X, even if
# the rest of the build is done with OS 9.
