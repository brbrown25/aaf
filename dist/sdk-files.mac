# The debug versions of the com-api, plugins, and static libraries.

# The debug libraries are more verbose in regards to error messages,
# and also will dump a stack trace if any error is detected by the AAF
# com library.  Of course, the debug libraries are also required in
# order to run a debugger.  In that case, the source distribution will
# also be required.
