#
# Usage: update.sh <new file> <file to update>
#
# The script checks if two files are different. If
# they are, it copies the first file over the second 
# one and makes it writable to be recognized by some 
# source control systems as modified.
# 
# If files are identical but the first file is newer 
# then the second one then the script sets the second
# file's modification date to latest so that 'make' 
# doesn't try to rebuild it.
#
# If none of the above is true, nothing happens.
