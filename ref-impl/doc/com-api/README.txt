Instructions for building an API Ref manual from the IDL with Doxygen

Requirements:

UNIX-like system with Doxygen installed (http://www.doxygen.org).
The initial development was done with version 1.3.9.1, but any version later
than this should work.
Windows systems should be able to handle this with Doxygen installed under
Cygwin.
Like the rest of the SDK, the Makefile in this directory depends on the use
of GNU Make.

For building Windows HTML Help (.chm) files, you need Microsoft's HTML Help
Workshop (free).


Background:

Doxygen reads the IDL files generated by dodo.  It produces two sets of
documentation, one for the COM API (the main API of the SDK) and one for the
Plug-In API.  It currently produces HTML documentation and (optionally, on
Windows only) Windows HTMLHelp .chm files.

The Plug-In API cross-links into the COM API for easy cross referencing of
types shared by the two. Because of this behavior, the Plug-In documentation
assumes that the COM API documentation is installed in parallel with it. 
The COM API can be used independantly (technically speaking, so can the
Plug-In API docs, but some links will just be broken).

This is the layout the generated documentation expects (for either the web
server installed version, or an offline version from an archive).

BASE_DIRECTORY/
   aafapiman/
      ... COM API files ...
   pluginapiman/
      ... Plug-In API files ...

This layout can be observed in the output directory following the generation
of the documentation.

Generation Steps 

1. Do a CVS update on your workspace to make sure the dodo files and headers
are up to date

2. Run 'make' in this directory (AAF/ref-impl/doc/com-api).  This will
generate the HTML versions of both documentation sets in the 'output'
directory (AAF/ref-impl/doc/com-api/output).

3. If you want archives of these, do 'make doczip'. This will make two ZIP
files, one for each documentation set.

4. HTML Help support is not yet in the Makefile. If you want the Microsoft
HTML Help format (.chm), start Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop. Open the
project files in each of the documentation set's output directories (these
projects are generated by Doxygen when the HTML documentation is created). 
Instruct HTML Help Workshop to build the project and the 'chm' file will be
made.
