AAFTestProgram.xml.zip can be viewed using MagicDraw.  However, a pdf file exists for viewing.

The scripts one directory up are used to auto-generate code:  

- NodeRegistryGen.sh generates the code which registers AAFObjects in NodeFactoryRegistry.  
- TypedVisitorGen.sh creates the TypedVisitor cpp and h files.  
- generator.sh uses the MetaDictionary.h file to populate a list of AAFObjects.  This list is used by the above scripts.
