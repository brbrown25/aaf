	The AAF Analyzer is currently composed of eight libraries.  Three of the
libraries (AnalyzerBase, RequirementLib and TestPhaseLib) are completely
independent from AAF.  These libraries can be reused as the foundations of
another analyzer type program.

	The library AAFAnalyzerBase builds upon the AnalyzerBase library and is used
by the BaseTestImpl library which also uses the RequirementLib and TestPhaseLib
libraries.  The AAFAnalyzerBase library extends the AnalyzerBase library for use
with AAF.  The BaseTestImpl library implements tests that test the structure of
an AAF file versus the AAF Object Specification.

	The library EPAnalyzerBase build upon the AAFAnalyzerBase and is used by
the EditProtocolTestImpl library which also uses the RequirementLib and
TestPhaseLib libraries.  The EPAnalyzerBase library extends the AAFAnalyzerBase
library for use with Edit Protocol data types.  The EditProtocolTestImpl
library implements test that the the structure of AAF files versus the Edit
Protocol specification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AnalyzerBase:

	The AnalyzerBase library provides the tools needed to build and traverse a
graph out of the contents of a file.

TestGraph - Container for the graph that is built by reading a file.  A
			TestGraph can be explored and nodes in the graph can be
			individually tested.  The decorator pattern may be used to add
			functionality to nodes of the graph.  A node should never be
			directly decorated because this will cause there to be references to
			the decorated and the undecorated node.  In order to decorate a
			node, the Decorate function of the TestGraph should be called.
			
Node - Represents a node on the test graph.  Nodes can be visited to analyze
	   their contents.  The decorator pattern may be used to add functionality
	   to a specific node.  If special processing is needed when the node is
	   decorated, that functionality should be implemented by overriding the
	   Decorate method.
	   
Edge - An Edge represents a path from one node to another.  Edges are directed
	   and have a parent and a child node.
	   
EdgeMap - A TestGraph has an EdgeMap.  The EdgeMap stores all edges that
		  connect nodes within the TestGraph.

Visitor - A visitor is capable of visiting a node an analyzing the node to
		  determine if the node meets a set of criteria.
		  
DepthFirstTraversal - Provides methods to visit nodes in a test graph by
					  traversing up or down the graph from a specified starting
					  node.
					  
AnalyzerException - Exceptions thrown by any analyzer program should extend
					from an AnalyzerException.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RequirementLib:

	The RequirementLib library provides tools required to parse requirements
out of an XML file and use them in the analysis process.  After being read,
analysis may be done to determine if a TestGraph meets the requirements.

RequirementLoader - Reads an XML file and creates and stores Requirement
					objects in the RequirementRegistry.
					
RequirementXMLException - Thrown when the RequirementLoader encounters a problem
						  while attempting to parse the XML requirement file.
						  
Requirement - Container for a requirement id, requirement type, requirement
			  category, requirement name, requirement description and a
			  document reference for the requirement.
			  
RequirementRegistry - Single spot of storage for all requirements that have
					  been loaded by an analyzer program.  Any part of an
					  analyzer program may access the RequirementRegistry and
					  obtain Requirement Objects based upon their ids.
					  
RequirementMismatchException - Thrown by RequirementRegistry when attempting to
							   register a requirement that has already been
							   accessed or when attempting to access an
							   unregistered requirement.
							   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TestPhaseLib:

	The TestPhaseLib library provides the foundation for implementing tests and
phases of tests.  It also provides a mechanism for reporting the results of
tests as well as the results of subtests and collections of tests.

Test - Base class for any test to be implemented.  Before being run, a test
	   must be registered with the TestRegistry.  In order to register with the
	   TestRegistry, a test must implement a static method GetTestInfo() that
       returns a TestInfo object.

TestPhase - Base class for any test phase to be implemented.

TestRegistry - Stores the requirements associated with every test that has been
			   registered.  Any part of an analyzer program may access the
			   TestRegistry and obtain its requirements based upon the Tests
			   name.
			   
TestRegistryException - Thrown by TestRegistry when attempting to register a
						test that is already registered or when attempting to
						find the requirements for an unregistered test.
						
TestInfo - Container for the name of a test and the requirements associated
		   with that test.
		   
TestInfoRegistrar - Used to register tests with the TestRegistry.  Registration
					is accomplished by specifying a test as the template
					parameter of the TestInfoRegistrar constructor.  If the test
					does not implement a static method GetTestInfo() returning a
					TestInfo object, the analyzer will not compile.
					
TestResult - Base interface for storing the results of the run analyzer, a test
			 phase, a test or a sub-test.  Indicates the overall result as well
			 as the a pass/fail/warn indication for each requirement that was
			 tested. Contains a collection of sub-TestResults.  GetResultType()
			 is a pure virtual method with the sole purpose of preventing a
			 TestResult class from being instantiated.
			 
HighLevelTestResult - Interface for storing the results of an analyzer run or a
					  test phase.  GetResultType() is a pure virtual method with
					  the sole purpose of preventing a HighLevelTestResult class
					  from being instantiated.
					  
LowLevelTestResult - Interface for storing the results of a test or a sub-test.
					 GetResultType() is a pure virtual method with the sole
					 purpose of preventing a LowLevelTestResult from being
					 instantiated.
					 
TopLevelTestResult - Used to report the overall results of an analyzer program.
					 May only contain TestPhaseLevelTestResults as
					 sub-TestResults.  Requirement pass/fail/warn statuses are
					 automatically updated when sub-TestResults are appended.
					 
TestPhaseLevelTestResult - Used to report the results of a TestPhase.  May only
						   contain TestLevelTestResults as sub-TestResults. 
						   Requirement pass/fail/warn statuses are
						   automatically updated when sub-TestResults are
						   appended.
						   
TestLevelTestResult - Used to report the results of a Test.  The requirements
					  that are specified as being part of the test result must
					  be identical to the requirements specified as being part
					  of the associated test. May only contain
					  DetailLevelTestResults as sub-TestResults. Requirement
					  pass/fail/warn statuses are not updated when a
					  sub-TestResults are appended.
					  
DetailLevelTestResults - Used to report the results of sub-tests (visitors). 
						 May only contain other DetailLevelTestResults as
						 sub-TestResults. Requirement pass/fail/warn statuses
						 are not updated when a sub-TestResult is appended.
						 
RequirementMismatchException - Thrown by TestLevelTestResult when the
							   requirements for a TestLevelTestResult do not
							   match the requirements of the associated test,
							   or when attempting to append a
							   DetailLevelTestResult which has a requirement
							   that is not part of the TestLevelTestResult.

						   that visitors correctly receive a decorate object
						   and not the AAFTypedObjectNode in their
						   PreOrderVisit() and PostOrderVisit() methods.
						   
GraphBuilder - Creates a TestGraph and AAFGraphInfo by reading an AAF input
			   file.
			   
AAFGraphInfo - Container for a TestGraph and an AxFile.  When the AAFGraphInfo

			   AAFObjNodes and any derived nodes will not be able to access the
			   AAF interface of the objects associated with those nodes.
			   
MobNodeMap - A map storing all nodes in the TestGraph that contain Mob objects.
			 Any part of an AAFAnalyer program may access the MobNodeMap in
			 order to access, decorate or remove nodes.

TypedNodeFactoryRegistry - Registry that stores every instantiation of a
						   TypedNodeFactoryImpl.  NodeFactoryImpl uses the
						   TypedNodeFactoryRegistry to forward CreateNode()
						   requests to the appropriate TypedNodeFactory.  Any
						   part of an AAFAnalyzer may access the
						   TypedNodeFactoryRegister to register or deregister
						   factories or to obtain a TypedNodeFactory.
						   
TypedVisitor - Derived from the visitor class, implements PreOrderVisit and
			   PostOrderVisit methods that take AAFTypedObjNodes as
			   parameters. The methods are implemented for each AAF object. 
			   Also, EdgeVisit methods are implemented for each class in the
			   AAFAnalyzer library derived from Edge.

					IAAFSourceMob		EPTapeSource
					
EPTypedVisitor - Derived from TypedVisitor.  Implements PreOrderVisit() and
				 PostOrderVisit() for EPTypedObjNodes with the parameters in the
				 above list. The default behaviour of these functions is to call
				 the same function using an appropriate AAFTypedObjNode.  In
				 order to accomplish this, the PreOrderVisit and PostOrderVisit
				 methods in TypedVisitor are exposed using the using
			     declaration.
				 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TestPhaseLib:

	The TestPhaseLib library implements the test used to test the basic
