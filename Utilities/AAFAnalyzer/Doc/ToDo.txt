1) The TestResult class needs some refinement:
   - It should stored a hiearchy of test results.
   - We break down the tests into:
	- A TestPhase
	- A TestPhase executes one or more Tests.
	- A Test is implemented (typically) using one or more Visitors.
   - When a failure occurs, each of these have a result to report.
   - We need to keep a record of the results from top, to bottom,
     with increasing levels of detail.
   - A tree of TestResults would do the job. If necessary we could
     specialize the test results to represent TestPhase results, and
     Test results, and the details results that are created as a result
     of teh processing done by one Test.

2) Some of Demitri's low level test results are not being propogated
up. This requires review.
